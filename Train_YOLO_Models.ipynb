        "Now that the data is organized and the config file is created, we're ready to start training! First, there are a few important parameters to decide on. Visit my article on [Training YOLO Models Locally](https://www.ejtech.io/learn/train-yolo-models) to learn more about these parameters and how to choose them.\n",

        "**Model architecture & size (`model`):**\n",
        "\n",
        "There are several YOLO11 models sizes available to train, including `yolo11n.pt`, `yolo11s.pt`, `yolo11m.pt`, `yolo11l.pt`, and `yolo11xl.pt`. Larger models run slower but have higher accuracy, while smaller models run faster but have lower accuracy. I made a brief YouTube video that compares performance of different YOLO models on a Raspberry Pi 5 and a laptop with a RTX 4050 GPU, [check it out here to get a sense of their speed accuracy](https://youtu.be/_WKS4E9SmkA). If you aren't sure which model size to use, `yolo11s.pt` is a good starting point.\n",

        "\n",
        "In machine learning, one “epoch” is one single pass through the full training dataset. Setting the number of epochs dictates how long the model will train for. The best amount of epochs to use depends on the size of the dataset and the model architecture. If your dataset has less than 200 images, a good starting point is 60 epochs. If your dataset has more than 200 images, a good starting point is 40 epochs.\n",

        "Resolution has a large impact on the speed and accuracy of the model: a lower resolution model will have higher speed but less accuracy. YOLO models are typically trained and inferenced at a 640x640 resolution. However, if you want your model to run faster or know you will be working with low-resolution images, try using a lower resolution like 480x480.\n"
